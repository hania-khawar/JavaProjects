# JavaProjects
This repository contains a collection of small Java projects developed as part of my A-Level Information Technology coursework.  
Each project demonstrates core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, data structures, and problem-solving logic.  

The goal of this repository is to showcase my understanding of Java fundamentals and practical coding experience.

## Projects Included
